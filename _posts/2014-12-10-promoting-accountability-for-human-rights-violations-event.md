On December 10, 2014, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and The International Criminal Justice Consortium co-sponsored an event entitled: "Promoting Accountability for Human Rights Violations" in observance of International Human Rights Day. This event featured a keynote address by the Honorable Judge Sang-Hyun Song, President of the International Criminal Court, as well as a panel discussion of experts in human rights law.

In his keynote address, Mr. Song highlighted the detrimental effect that international crimes have on society: “[genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes] frequently cause the breakdown of social structures, denying a series of other rights.” Mr. Song clarified that the ICC "is not a method for settling old scores. It is an insurance policy for a better future.”

The evening event focused on the importance of international criminal justice to the larger human rights movement. Specifically, the event considered the necessity of a swift and effective international justice system to the prevention of future mass human rights abuses.
