In recognition of International Criminal Justice Day, we should recall the words of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., “true peace is not merely the absence of tension, it is the presence of justice.” If states, international organizations, and civil society want to forge a lasting peace around the world, they must commit themselves to confronting all instances of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes with the rule of law. As the international community celebrates the momentous passage of the Rome Statute on 17 July 1998, the International Criminal Justice Consortium reaffirms the international legal community’s responsibility to help establish an international rule of law that is both effective and efficient. Building such a system is not only vital to ending impunity for atrocities, but to restoring the dignity of communities and people ripped apart by human savagery. 

The International Criminal Justice Consortium is an independent, nonpartisan alliance of international organizations established to provide comprehensive practical and expert support to criminal justice institutions at the national and international levels. The Consortium’s members come from diverse, expert perspectives in international and domestic criminal justice, and are united in their belief that accountability for international atrocity crimes is crucial in ensuring international peace, security, and well-being.
