On March 25, 2015, The Hague Institute for Global Justice, in conjunction and as a member of the International Criminal Justice Consortium, hosted an event entitled “*Addressing Sexual and Gender-Based Crimes - The State-of-the-Art and Ways Forward*.” The event included opening remark by Dr. Abiodun Williams, President of the Hague Institute for Global Justice, and H.E. Håkan Emsgård, Sweden’s Ambassador to the Netherlands. These remarks were followed by a panel discussion featuring: Fabricio Guariglia, Director of the Prosecutions Division of the Office of the Prosecutor, International Criminal Court; Brigid Inder, Special Gender Advisor to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and Executive Director, Women's Initiatives for Gender Justice; Michelle Jarvis, Principal Legal Counsel, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia; and Birgitta Weibahr, Senior Policy Expert on Democracy and Human Rights, Swedish International Development Organisation (SIDA) with moderator Dr. Jelke Boesten, Senior Lecturer in Emerging Economies and International Development, King’s College London. The panelists’ expertise in international criminal prosecutions, sexual and gender based crimes, and international development provided for a dynamic and multifaceted discussion on pressing issues in the fight against sexual and gender based crimes.
Topics discussed included collaboration between the ICC and national judiciaries and other relevant actors on addressing sexual and gender based crimes, gaps in relevant capacity building, and how best to implement domestic sexual and gender based crimes legislation. 

Prior to this panel discussion, The Hague Institute for Global Justice organised an [experts roundtable](http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Events-Events-Upcoming_events-High-Level_Roundtable:_Addressing_Sexual_and_Gender-Based_Crimes&pid=123&id=243) on sexual and gender based crimes.

*“There are distinct challenges in relation to liability for sexual gender based crimes and international crimes. . . . it is not that the standard which establishes it beyond reasonable doubt is lower; it is in fact, higher.”* 
Brigid Inder, Special Gender Advisor to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and Executive Director, Women's Initiatives for Gender Justice
