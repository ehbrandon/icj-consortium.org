title: Proven Practices in International Criminal Justice

The investigation, prosecution, and adjudication of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes is some of the most difficult criminal casework, regardless if done at the international or national level. The practical approaches, methodologies, and strategies used by investigators, lawyers, and judges often dictate just how effective and efficient international criminal justice is.

While much attention is devoted to the law and politics surrounding international criminal justice, the practical work is often overlooked. Either due to lack of resources or the temporary status of tribunals with jurisdiction over these crimes, the practical knowledge and experience of those who have done this complex work has not been systematically captured and codified, and thereafter disseminated in a useful manner.

The Proven Practices of International Criminal Justice initiative is addressing this need. Through a combination of online roundtables, in-person conferences, and commentary, the Proven Practices of International Criminal Justice – from initial investigations to appellate hearings – will be made available online for both national and international practitioners to consult and use. In the end, this online resource created by and for international criminal practitioners will help this field of law become increasingly more effective and efficient, an important objective shared by all.
