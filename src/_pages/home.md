title: The International Criminal Justice Consortium
---
International criminal justice - or accountability for the international atrocity crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and aggression - is fundamental to deterring the commission of such egregious crimes and key to ensuring the "peace, security and well-being of the world." The International Criminal Justice Consortium (ICJC) is an independent, nonpartisan alliance of organisations from around the world committed to providing practical and expert support to international criminal justice at the national and international level. The work of the ICJC is *pro bono*, confidential, and driven by request and the needs of its partners. The ICJC's work is geared towards national jurisdictions and international judicial institutions, including the International Criminal Court (ICC),  to assist capacity building activities through practical legal skills workshops, exchanges of expertise retreats, comparative legal analysis, and other similar collaborations.

##### Expansive Resources, Varied Perspectives

The collective membership of the ICJC is able to draw upon outstanding judicial, prosecutorial, legal, and administrative practitioners from legal traditions and regions throughout the world. The ICJC is able to provide perspectives from varied professional, judicial, and legal organisations, academic institutions, training academies, and human rights groups. ICJC and its members are also able to work in numerous languages, and convene events within The Hague, throughout Europe, and around the world.

##### Independent and Flexible

As an independent and impartial resource of practical and technical support, the ICJC focuses on the sharing of expertise and best practices.

##### Sustainable and Efficient Model of Support

The ICJC is institutionally-based with member organisations formally joining the Consortium. The ICJC Steering Committee helps to streamline communication with and between the national jurisdictions or the ICC and Consortium membership, ensuring that collaboration is efficiently developed and implemented.
