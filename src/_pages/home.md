title: The International Criminal Justice Consortium
---
International criminal justice - or accountability for the international atrocity crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and aggression - is fundamental to replacing conflict with durable peace. The International Criminal Justice Consortium (ICJC) is an independent, nonpartisan alliance of international organisations committed to providing practical support to international criminal justice at the national level and at the International Criminal Court (ICC). The work of the ICJC is *pro bono*, confidential, and driven by the client. The ICJC works with national jurisdictions and the ICC to identify, develop, and implement capacity building activities such as practical legal skills workshops, exchanges of expertise retreats, comparative legal analysis, and other similar collaborations.

##### Expansive Resources, Varied Perspectives

The collective membership of the ICJC is able to draw upon outstanding judicial, prosecutorial, legal and administrative practitioners from legal traditions and regions throughout the world. The ICJC is able to provide perspectives from varied professional, judicial and legal organisations, academic institutions, training academies, and human rights groups. ICJC and its members are also able to convene events within The Hague, throughout Europe, and around the world.

##### Independent and Flexible

As an independent and impartial resource of practical support, the ICJC focuses on best practices sharing, not political agendas.

##### Sustainable and Efficient Model of Support

The ICJC is institutionally-based, with member organisations formally joining the Consortium. The ICJC Steering Committee helps to streamline communication with and between the national jurisdictions or the ICC and Consortium membership, ensuring that collaboration is efficiently developed and implemented.
